# DMST-Applied-Machine-Learning-Assignments

This repository is dedicated to the demonstration and familirization with the concepts of data analysis and machine learning. It was created for the needs of the course "Applied Machine Learning" offered by the [Department of Management Science and Technology](https://www.aueb.gr/el/content/department-management-science-and-technology) of the [Athens University of Economics and Business](https://www.aueb.gr/).

During the aforementioned course, I completed three assignments, focusing on different aspects and tools. More specifically: 
* The 1st assignment aims to demonstrate the use of pandas and plotting libraries through the examination of a dataset from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Centers for Environmental Information.
* The 2nd assignment focuses on the reproduction of a [paper survey on guns and belief in supernatural evil](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0049089X21000727) through statistical analysis.
* The 3rd assignment aims to compare the traditional machine learning methods with a neural network and predict valence, a Spotify metric.
